      review: `This template is awesome! It's super easy to get started, uses Material UI perfectly, and the folder structure is a breeze to navigate. Plus, it's really affordable. The coding style is top-notch too, making everything clear and easy to grasp. Surprisingly, I haven't even needed the documentation to set it up. Big shoutout to the team behind this gem. Can't wait to see what else they come up with! Definitely recommend giving it a try!`,
